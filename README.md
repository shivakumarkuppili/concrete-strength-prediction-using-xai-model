Abstract: 
This project demonstrates the potential of leveraging advanced deep learning models to accurately predict the compressive strength of concrete, enhancing construction quality and efficiency. Future improvements will focus on exploring advanced architectures like CNNs and transformer models, integrating IoT sensors for real-time monitoring, and expanding datasets to include diverse concrete mixes and environmental conditions. Hybrid approaches combining deep learning with ensemble techniques will be employed to improve both performance and interpretability. Additionally, advanced Explainable AI (XAI) methods will be developed to provide actionable insights, while sustainability assessments will guide eco-friendly and cost-effective construction practices. These advancements aim to enable automated, real-time quality control systems for modern construction needs.
